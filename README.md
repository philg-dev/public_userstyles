As I saw some people being annoyed by the floating toolbar for rich text formatting
and by the placeholder in empty lines that says *"Type / for menu"*, I've made a
userstyle to hide those elements.

The formatting toolbar on the bottom can still be used as normal and the
"menu" will still open normally when you type `/` at the beginning of a new line.

The userstyle is available for easy install with Stylus via the button above or
on `userstyles.world`:
