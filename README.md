# Public Userstyles Collection

## Asana Tweaks

As I saw some people being annoyed by the floating toolbar for rich text formatting
and by the placeholder in empty lines that says "Type / for menu", I've made a
userstyle to hide those elements.

The formatting toolbar on the bottom can still be used as normal and the
"menu" will still open normally when you type "/" at the beginning of a new line.
